It's time for a short update about what's going on with Trolddom and what will happen next. My goal is to keep the updates a bit more consistent and avoid long months of radio silence making people think that
nothing is happening. More information about what I'm working on and more numerous, but smaller, updates to the game. 

# Next big patch
Last big update increased the level cap from 10 to 20, which was great when it finally happened, but it just took forever to get out the door. For that reason, from now on, level cap increases will be in much smaller increments. Next bump will be to 22.

To accommodate the increased level cap there will be a couple of new zones for leveling, including the Xandralis jungle. There will also be a new dungeon where you'll face off with the orc warlord Karthul Blackfang, leader of the Skullforge Clan.

I'm trying my best to limit the scope of this update as much as possible and I'll do my best not to jump into any rabbit holes, no matter how inviting they may look. I won't dare giving you an accurate timeframe for this, so let's just say it will be out much, much faster than the previous big update.

## Futher ahead
I've also been fiddling around with a new game mode. Considering that it sometimes can be difficult to find people to play with, I've tried to come up with a bit more end-game single player content. The result of this is _Solo Survival_ (which as the name suggests also comes in a party flavor for more people).

The gist of it: you spawn into an instanced area where you'll fight off waves of increasingly difficult monsters. During the session you'll obtain buffs and abilities through a special survival progression system. Some of these things can drastically alter your class, so you'll get plenty of opportunity to try out different things. Fighters shooting explosive arrows? Paladin Consecration doing frost damage? Lots of weird things will be possible. There will obviously be different categories of leaderboards.

I'm not really sure when _Survival_ will be ready, as for now I feel it's more important to add more normal content to the game.

## This was a short one
As I said, this would be a short little update. I need to get back to making quests and stuff.
