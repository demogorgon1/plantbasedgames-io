The game has been buzzing with activity over the holidays, due to all the new players brought along by the Steam winter event. Didn't expect to have the all time highest number of players online more than a year after the original release. Anyway, activity might drop for a while, but it doesn't mean that the frequency of game updates will. At least I hope not. In this short post I'll give a summary of what things I imagine are coming soon'ish. 

# Next up
![Possessed](/blog/images/possessed.gif)
While chipping away at some of the more long-standing bugs, some of them hopefully fixed the most recent patch, I've been working on a new mechanic: possession. I felt a bit bad about removing the seasonal random winter hats, so this is something that works a similar way. Kinda. Basically you'll find that some random humanoids across the world have become possessed by demons. When killed these NPCs will drop a special type of (tradable) item, which you can collect to summon demonic entities for you to banish. Using more of these items at the same time allows you to summon increasingly powerful enemies (with increasingly powerful loot). The difficulty will range from soloable to being almost impossible. The demons will be largely randomly generated so you'll never know what you're gonna get. Some new zones and quests will be tied into this.

# ... and after that?
One very industrious player, known as Karraticus on Discord, has put a lot of work into a new class: the druid. Their work obviously needs to be integrated properly into the game somehow. It's gonna be great, lots of shape-shifting shenanigans incoming. I also imagine a new starting zone just for druids, but lets see how it goes.

Also expect some new heroic modes, various smaller fixes and quality-of-life updates along the way. 

As I said, this would just be a very short update on what's going on. Stay tuned!
